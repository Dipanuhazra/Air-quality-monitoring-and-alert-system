# Air-quality-monitoring-and-alert-system
This setup provides a basic framework for an air quality monitoring and alert system. The front end displays a real-time map with air quality data from various sensors, and the back end provides the necessary data and alerts. We can expand and improve upon this basic framework with more sophisticated data and functionalities as needed.
